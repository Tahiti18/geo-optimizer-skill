"""Denylist of domains that are NOT competitors when cited by an AI answer.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
v1 competitor detection treated *every* cited domain except the business's own
as a "competitor". But AI answers cite reference, review, social, directory,
marketplace, and documentation sites constantly — Wikipedia, Reddit, Yelp,
Facebook, Amazon, .gov/.edu pages. Reporting "wikipedia.org is your competitor"
destroys credibility in the single most demo-critical output. This module
filters those out so `competitor_domains` contains plausible *businesses*.

HOW IT CAN FAIL
---------------
- It is a denylist, not semantic understanding. A genuine competitor whose
  domain we haven't listed still passes through (acceptable: false positives on
  *non*-competitors are the credibility killer; a missed filter just leaves a
  real domain, which is usually fine).
- A listed platform could occasionally BE the relevant competitor (e.g. a
  business that competes with Yelp). Edge case; ignored in v1.
- Country-specific directories/socials are under-covered.

HOW IT SHOULD EVOLVE
--------------------
- Replace/augment with a category-aware allowlist of known competitors per
  vertical, and ultimately learn competitors from repeated co-occurrence across
  many probes (the dataset moat). Until then, an explicit per-entity
  competitor list (already supported in analysis) is the precise path.
